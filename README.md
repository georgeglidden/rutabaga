A similar project, rootviz, was created by nessig.github.io

### To-Do:
- generate a density map from a set of points
- consistent or at least comprehensible color encoding(s) for density maps at arbitrary intervals
- render the density map + encoding in a browser
- find all real & complex roots to a  q-polynomial constrained over a rectangular interval
- ... quickly enough to dynamically serve them to an arbitrary number of clients
- ... efficiently enough to run on the browser
- try webASM implementations of the root-finder
